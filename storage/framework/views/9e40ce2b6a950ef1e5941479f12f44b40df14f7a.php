				For most of my career, I was a Teacher for one category or another. In my early career as a Junior Scientist, I was a trainee teacher Learning and Developing scientific methodologies. From there I moved into commerce as a Business Executive teaching Juniors the ins and outs of Economics and Business strategy. Soon I moved into Marketing and Sales and eventually ventured into my own companies in International Trade, Hospitality, Manufacturing, and Consulting. In between I completed 4 Masters Degrees and PG Diplomas in English Literature, TechnologyEducation, Teaching and Information Technology. A long career in teaching Secondary school students led me to include coaching graduates, Post Graduate and Doctoral students in their respective fields.

				Finally, I worked with several top Mentoring businesses and thoroughly enjoyed the work and outcome. Starting up TopClasstutors was a dream I nurtured for a few years. With the backing of a strong team, we are ready to take any interested student on their own journey to success.
